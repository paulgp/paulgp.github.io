I just posted a draft of a new paper with the amazing [Peter Hull](https://about.peterhull.net/) and [Michal Kolesár](https://www.princeton.edu/~mkolesar/): [Leniency Designs: An Operator's Manual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03572). I will post a longer summary later, but hope you'll take a look!

>We develop a step-by-step guide to leniency (a.k.a. judge or examiner instrument) designs, drawing on recent econometric literatures. The unbiased jackknife instrumental variables estimator (UJIVE) is purpose-built for leveraging exogenous leniency variation, avoiding subtle biases even in the presence of many decision-makers or controls. We show how UJIVE can also be used to assess key assumptions underlying leniency designs, including quasi-random assignment and average first-stage monotonicity, and to probe the external validity of treatment effect estimates. We further discuss statistical inference, arguing that non-clustered standard errors are often appropriate. A reanalysis of Farre-Mensa et al. (2020), using quasi-random examiner assignment to estimate the value of patents to startups, illustrates our checklist.
