## Topics for today:

1. VS Code + Copilot installation
2. Examples using Chat LLMs for Research and Teaching
3. Images from Midjourney
4. Running your own LLM locally


Goal for today's chat is to highlight a number of useful ways that you can use AI in your research and teaching. I'm using AI super loosely here -- what I really mean is the relatively new innovations of Large Language Models that have sprung up following the release of ChatGPT 3.


## VS Code + Copilot 

A big chunk of what I want to show you revolves around [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is a free, open-source editor that is quite powerful and has a lot of extensions that make it a great choice for coding. Benefits (some for today, some for next week):

1. Free
2. Good IDE with broad support
3. Built-in Git that is quite good (see next talk)
4. Great remote access
5. Copilot (LLM for inline code suggestions and chat program)
6. Extensions with open community (good for many software platforms, also alows extensions in CodeGPT)



[I wrote a blog post](https://paulgp.substack.com/p/setting-up-github-copilot-and-vscode) last year on setting this up, but I'll walk through it here as well.

1. Install VS Code 
    - https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Setup Coding Extensions (Much built-in, but good extensions)
    - Python (Python, Pylance, Python Debugger, autopep8)
    - R (R) 
        - radian
        - https://aeturrell.com/blog/posts/setting-up-r-in-vscode/
    - Stata (stataRun, Stata Enhanced)
        - This works in Mac OS well, not so well in Windows
    - LaTeX (Latex Workshop) ([sometimes can't find latex compiler, see here](https://vkuhlmann.com/latex/configuration/fixingVSCode#fixing-using-the-wizard))
    - Remote
        - Per Kyle's talk!
3. Install Copilot + Chat
    - https://github.com/features/copilot/plans
    - In the extensions!
4. Setup Preferences (backend of VS Code is basically a web broswer)
    - Theme
    - Font
    - Keybindings
    - Settings

### Known issues I've had
1. Launch vscode from the command line vs. from Applications -- the PATH variable isn't the same for each, and many of the relevant programs are on the command line PATH variable
2. Sometimes the latex compiler or python interpreter can't be found. This is a PATH issue.
3. Sometimes httpgd messes up inside VS Code. I often will have the graphs in a separate window, instead, but can be annoying. 

### Some examples of how Copilot is awesome
1. Example prompt/script for scraping data
2. Converting HTML to markdown
3. Creating comments for code

### Copilot vs. CodeGPT
* Copilot is the official Microsoft LLM product, and quite good
* CodeGPT is an extension by a third-party that uses other LLMs as their backend. 
* Key benefit from CodeGPT -- ability to use other LLMs (such as more cutting edge LLMs like Claude or ChatGPT 4)
* More importantly -- can use open source LLMs run locally
    - This can be helpful for people trying to set things up in sensitive environments!


# Chat LLMs for Research and Teaching
I am going to walk through a number of cool use cases here. 


1. Write script to scrape data 
    * Example: Pull NBER Working paper codes
    * Example: pull all journal of finance brattle prize winners. Look at how citation counts correlate with probability of winning
2. Construct a make file for a project
    * Use example  [README  from Bartik paper](http://paulgp.github.io/files/README_bartik.pdf) + Claude
3. Quiz questions for class -> mapping to qualtrics

    Prompt for class:
    ```
    I'm writing a multiple choice short quiz for a class called 
    "Investment Management" for MBA students.
    You're going to help me write the quizzes. 
    My questions look like this:

    \\\`latex

    \\question The CAPM model is a single factor model. What is the factor? 
    \\begin{choices}
    \\choice The risk-free rate
    \\correctchoice The market risk premium
    \\choice The market return
    \\choice The market volatility
    \\end{choices} 
    \\\`

    Generally, I want you to ask questions that probe understanding and
    require students to use logic, not just memory. Feel free to use 
    situational questions like "Imagine that...". Please acknowledge.
    ```

    Now we'll give it my materials from a day of class:

    ```
    Let's write five questions evaluating the material 
    in these slides that are attached.
    ```

    I currently manually copy this into a Qualtrics survey, but figuring out how to automate that process as well (takes about 3 minutes, not a huge deal, but would be nice to do automatically). Would be even easier to do with Canvas, as it allows for QTI format (which can be converted from [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/text2qti/)).

4. Making clip art for slides

    Often, it is nice to make "clip art" for slides. Either title slides, or simply decoration to make your slides nicer (and more engaging) without adding text.  
    I use [Midjourney](https://discord.com/channels/1254821865805840495/1254821865805840498) to construct this type of "art."

    Example slides [here](https://paulgp.github.io/presentations/saffran_lecture.pdf)

5. Chatbots and using them for research purposes.

    Open AI has ChatGPT.

    Anthropic has Claude.

    Others include Gemini, Mixtral, and many alternatives (open source too). There are many to use. If you want to use your own, you need to set it up locally. This can be non-trivial, especially for the powerful ones. Would be good to have more of an expert chime in, but here are a few fun exmaples: 

    1. [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)
    2. [https://github.com/simonw/llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm)
    3. [https://github.com/npiv/chatblade](https://github.com/npiv/chatblade)

    But there are good and real research applications that you should consider, especially once combined with tuning.

6. Making your evaluations more paletable (and making evals more useful than just scores)

    Here's two sets of evals from my courses: [Investment Management](https://s3.amazonaws.com/file.paulgp.com/30d/28807_spring_2024_mgt_544_01-investment_management.pdf) and [Applied Empirical Methods](https://s3.amazonaws.com/file.paulgp.com/30d/31357_spring_2024_econ_574_01mgmt_737_01-applied_empirical_methods.pdf).

    Let's go through an evaluation and ask it to digest it for us:

    ```markdown
        I just got course evaluations for my class, Investment Management. I've attached the PDF of the reviews. Can you summarize and read through and give me the highlights? I'd like to hear positive stuff, to feel good, and also any constructive feedback I can take.
    ```


    ```
    Any particularly nice comments that I should add to my file of "feel good" comments?
    ```

    ```
    Can you give me any suggestions on how I can address the concerns raised by the students?
    ```

    ```
    Can you do the same now for these reviews for my PhD class?
    ```

7. Converting math to code

    Let's write some math on the board and ask it to convert it to LaTeX code.

8. Convert tables in papers to graphs (almost) instantly

    Let's take a table from [a paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X19301680) and [ask it to convert it to a graph.](https://claude.ai/chat/3f3d0a2b-7bcf-4ac3-aa93-f14e5126b46c)
