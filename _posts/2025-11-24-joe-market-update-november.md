As we reach mid-November in the 2024-2025 academic hiring cycle, the data from JOE (Job Openings for Economists) paints a concerning picture: **this year is shaping up to be the worst economics job market on record since at least 2015.**

This post provides an update to my [earlier analysis of JOE posting trends](/2025/10/08/joe-market-tracker.html) with fresh data through November 2025. All code and data remain [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/paulgp/joe-tracker).


## The Overall Market: A Historic Decline

The numbers are stark. As of week 47 (mid-November), cumulative postings for the 2024-2025 cycle stand at just **760 positions** - approximately:
- **37% below** the 2015-2019 average
- **17% below** even the pandemic-impacted 2020 cycle
- **38% below** last year's already-depressed levels

If this trajectory continues, we're on track to finish the year with the lowest total posting count in over a decade. 

This finding is in line with a recent post by [John Cawley on X/Twitter](https://x.com/cawley_john/status/1986196028685754412):

## A Silver Lining: Finance Jobs Show Resilience

In contrast to the overall market's collapse, **finance positions show a more resilient pattern**. While still below their 2015-2018 peak (~150 postings per year), finance jobs are tracking much closer to recent years' levels at around 95 positions.

Perhaps most telling: finance jobs now represent **12.5% of all JOE postings** in 2025, up from the typical 7-9% in recent years. This isn't because finance hiring has surged - rather, it reflects that finance demand has held relatively steady while other fields have contracted sharply.

### Finance Jobs by Year

| Year | Finance Postings | % of Total | Notes |
|------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 2015 | 153 | 9.9% | Pre-decline peak |
| 2016 | 131 | 9.1% | |
| 2017 | 138 | 9.1% | |
| 2018 | 153 | 9.8% | Peak year |
| 2019 | 137 | 9.4% | |
| 2020 | 103 | 9.1% | Pandemic impact |
| 2021 | 123 | 8.8% | |
| 2022 | 103 | 6.9% | |
| 2023 | 93 | 7.2% | |
| 2024 | 102 | 8.3% | |
| **2025** | **95** | **12.5%** | **Relatively stable** |

The data suggests that **the current market contraction is hitting non-finance fields particularly hard**. But, it may be that JOE is less of a relevant source of job postings now --- there may be a fragmentation of job posting locations, as well as a decentralization of private sector postings.
