title: Gary Chamberlain Lecture Notes from Harvard's Econ 2120 Course
---

Gary Chamberlain's family granted approval for me to post the
collected set of lecture notes from the late Gary Chamberlain's 2010
Econometrics class (EC2120) that I took during my economics Ph.D. at
Harvard University. Gary was a remarkable teacher and this class was
an amazing experience for me as a young economist. I hope you find
these lectures as enthralling as I did!
