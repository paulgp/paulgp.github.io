There was an [interesting story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/09/05/diverse-college-enrollment-down-post-affirmative-action-ruling/) in the Washington Post about the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina* and *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College* on the racial composition of new college students. As the semester begins, a trickle of information about the current make-up of the class of 2028, and there is interest in understanding if this will have a large impact.

To quote some of the numbers:

> At UNC, 10.5 percent of first-year and transfer students enrolling in the fall of 2023 identified as Black or African American, according to university officials. This fall, 7.8 percent did. The share identifying as Hispanic or Latino dipped slightly from 10.8 percent to 10.1 percent. The number identifying as Asian or Asian American rose slightly, from 24.8 percent last fall to 25.8 this year. The number of White or Caucasian students held steady â€” 63.7 last fall and 63.8 percent this fall.

> Princeton and Yale universities released data Wednesday indicating that the numbers of Black and Latino students in their entering classes is similar to the numbers that enrolled last year. At Princeton, 9 percent of the Class of 2027 identified as Black; 8.9 percent of the Class of 2028 did. Ten percent identified as Hispanic or Latino in the Class of 2027; in the Class of 2028, 9 percent did.

My main concern when I read this article is that there is tremendous signal being read into something that may have a lot of noise. Is this driven just by sampling error, or is actually a meaningful effect? There's no good way for the reporters at the Post to know, because the schools are not releasing data to allow them to compare. However, with IPEDS data, we can try to get a sense of how noisy these racial composition numbers are. 

To make the problem concrete: we have a measure **x** which is the share of students in a class that are Black.
