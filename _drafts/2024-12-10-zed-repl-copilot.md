In a previous post, [I discussed how to get started with VS Code and Copilot.](https://paulgp.substack.com/p/setting-up-github-copilot-and-vscode). I still endorse using VS Code, as it's a very powerful editor, and compatible with all the main languages I use -- R, Python, Stata, and Latex. It also lets me dabble in other things as well, like Julia and Gleam.
